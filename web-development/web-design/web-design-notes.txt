/******************* COLOR THEORY *******************/
- when picking colors be aware of the mood of color palette
    - red > love, energy, intensity
    - yellow > joy, intellect, attention
    - green > greshness, safety, growth
    - blue >  stability, trust, serenity 
    - purple > royalty, wealth, feminity

- what you shouldn't do with clashing colors:
    - style text and text background > instead keep it to things like logos or icons or things you really want to stand out

/******************* TYPOGRAPHY *******************/
- referring to Serif family
    - you can tell how old a typeface would look by looking at the difference between the thickest and the thinnest parts of each letter
    - for example: comparing the old style 'o' versus the transitional 'o' versus the modern 'o'

/******************* MANAGE ATTENTION *******************/
- establishing hierarchy
    - through color
    - size 
    - layout
    - alignment
    - white space
    - your audience

/******************* USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN *******************/
- UX > user experience is suppose to be invisible
- think about these five things
    1. simplicity 
    2. consistency (design and functionality)
    3. reading patterns 
        - F pattern > starts at top left corner then it tracks the right and then flips back again]
        - Z pattern > eyes go left to right, zigzagging > using this depends on the type of website
    4. all platform design (mobile, desktop, tablet)
    5. don't use your poswers for evil: ethics of design
